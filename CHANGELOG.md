# Changelog

All notable Octon Mini contract changes are recorded here. Project-specific
snapshots do not upgrade automatically.

## 4.0.0 — Unreleased

Velocity-focused major kernel release for solo developers, pairs, and tiny
teams, with concurrent human/agent/automation work modeled separately from
assurance profile.

This is the first Octon Mini release and the breaking successor to Project
Blueprint 3.x. Product version continuity is preserved; historical releases,
tags, decisions, and fixtures retain their Project Blueprint identity.

### Added

- the owner-approved MIT No Attribution (`MIT-0`) source license, included in
  the repository and installed source bundle but not projected as a generated
  target-project licensing decision;
- one authoritative profile, layout, package, inventory, and acceptance
  manifest, including criterion-level coverage for all 18 acceptance criteria;
- fast, integration, and release validation tiers, bounded mutation baselines,
  scale benchmarks, structured diagnostic codes, and read-only `octon doctor`;
- a shared staged plan/apply framework with target and instruction
  fingerprints, write-ahead recovery journals, exact receipts, safe rollback,
  and no force bypass;
- transactional work lifecycle, derived current state, explicit focus source,
  registry reconciliation, selective project checks, evidence archives, and
  resume/handoff views;
- guided initialization, content-aware adoption, progressive collaboration v2,
  safe detector recipes, content-addressed Git/domain packages, and a
  three-way live upgrade planner;
- independent compact and separated physical dossier layouts; and
- origin inventory v2, proposal/transaction/diagnostic/package/SCM/hook/focus/
  collaboration/upgrade schemas and the 3.1.0-to-4.0.0 migration guide;
- executable velocity journeys for guided creation, dirty-repository adoption,
  archetype detection, collaboration bands, lifecycle, interruption recovery,
  and stale-plan refusal; and
- golden paths, compatibility/deprecation guidance, a touchpoint/measurement
  plan, and 0/2k/10k/20k benchmark reporting;
- one `DEC-0001` decision-governance register with stable `DREG-####` tracking,
  owner-friendly workbook and gate-first trade-off review templates, exact
  inventory/reciprocal-authority/dependency validation, accepted-constraint
  reconciliation, compatibility dispositions, and an evidence-bound minimum
  closure graph;
- a scoped seven-level requirement/gate maturity assessment that cannot be
  promoted by structural validation, plus separate architecture,
  documentation, implementation, specialist, release, production, and efficacy
  conclusions; and
- a demonstrably read-only review protocol, subordinate-handoff claim checks,
  domain-neutral worked example, and positive/negative mutation fixtures.
- one provider-neutral `work.finish` engine shared by `solo_direct`,
  `solo_hybrid`, `pair_pr`, `tiny_pr`, `concurrent_work`, and every assurance
  profile, with write-free planning, exact digest/current authorization,
  opt-in post-closure plan-only dispatch, read-only hook observation,
  append-only Git-common-directory receipts and authorization history,
  idempotent resume, peer-review truthfulness, fast-forward synchronization,
  fail-closed Git-hook/fsmonitor observation, visible binding of exact closure
  evidence, safe cleanup, and
  positive/negative/interruption mutation coverage;
- explicit exact-pristine updates for an installed small-team Git portfolio,
  without enabling completion or overwriting project-owned workflow,
  provider, branch, hook, cleanup, or authorization settings;
- one guided, resumable setup interview shared by initialization, adoption,
  and upgrade, with a canonical question catalog, strict external session
  artifacts, dependency-ordered conversational/TTY/flag inputs, fail-closed
  freshness binding, work-completion opt-in closure planning, and no second
  apply or authority system;
- fail-closed continuation with typed no-change findings, dependency-scoped
  setup-session v2 successors, accepted-decision applicability reuse,
  interactive one-command init/adopt/upgrade, human plan summaries and semantic
  plan deltas, transaction v3 phase timing, conservative routine validation
  proof reuse, and compatible reversible local bundles with one receipt and
  rollback boundary;
- a source-only real-project usability protocol with a reusable content-free
  report template and material release-disposition boundary;
- a non-authorizing 4.0.0 release-readiness checklist that keeps tag, GitHub
  Release, and package-publication choices separate; and
- a source-only, non-enforcing large-project phase profiler that preserves
  benchmark-v2 thresholds and sample accounting.

### Changed

- the current product identity changes from Project Blueprint to Octon Mini,
  the lightweight, project-local version of Octon, while OctonOS remains the
  full-scale agent operating system and governed control plane;
- the bootstrap capability is named Octon Mini Project Bootstrap, with skill
  ID `octon-mini-project-bootstrap`;
- the sole current command is `octon`, and current schema, provenance,
  package, skill, and generated-path identities move to capability-qualified
  Octon Mini names;
- non-interactive generation requires an explicit profile; interactive init
  proposes Minimal and requires confirmation;
- `state/current.json` is fully derived while non-derivable operator intent is
  stored in `state/focus.json`;
- the Git workflow portfolio and operations/security extensions are no longer
  universal payloads and are installed only through reviewed, digest-bound
  trigger transactions;
- compact dossier representation is the new-project default without becoming
  an assurance or collaboration profile;
- the small-team Git portfolio version and digest are now rendered together
  from the authoritative package manifest and validated as an exact pair even
  while the package remains uninstalled;
- the source repository contract advances to
  `octon-mini.source.repository.v2` to bind the MIT-0 license file, package
  metadata, installed-source projection, and generated-project exclusion;
- validation benchmarks now use the distinct
  `octon-mini.project.validation-benchmark.v2` protocol, preserving one
  operational cold-start proxy plus ten warm samples, explicit host context,
  nearest-rank combined and warm p90, and the unchanged thresholds;
- source CI now cancels only superseded runs for the same pull request; push
  and manual evidence use unique concurrency groups and are not displaced by
  another run targeting `main`;
- generated repository and transaction tree walks now prune excluded
  directories with deterministic, non-symlink-following `os.scandir`
  traversal while retaining byte/mode identity semantics; and
- refresh reuses the post-validation invocation-local source inventory for its
  manifest, while retaining before-replacement fingerprint revalidation;
- primitive scaffolding uses structural plus bounded fast validation, while
  consequential init/adoption/upgrade/release transactions retain release-tier
  staging;
- the source and generated `octon` entry points use the same extensionless
  Python-launcher model, suppress bytecode writes, support `./octon` on
  Unix/macOS and `python -B octon` or `py -3 -B octon` on Windows, and keep the
  documented read-only check cache-free; and
- Octon Mini, the generator, and the harness kernel advance to 4.0.0.

### Removed

- the `pb` command, launcher, dispatcher, runtime-module names, aliases, and
  compatibility behavior. Project Blueprint identifiers remain only as
  truthful history or explicit legacy migration inputs.

### Compatibility and migration note

Generated snapshots remain independent. Existing Project Blueprint 3.x
projects are never rewritten automatically; use the reviewed migration seed
and `octon upgrade plan|apply` for the explicit Project Blueprint 3.x→Octon
Mini 4.0 migration. Only exact-pristine non-authoritative implementation
assets, safe additions, and derived regeneration are automatic. Instructions,
policy, configuration, workflows, dossier sources, registries, records, stable IDs,
deletions, moves, permissions, and symlinks require explicit review. Structural
conformance, harness adoption, and target-project readiness remain distinct.
Governed completion and its event hook remain disabled after migration until a
project explicitly adopts their repository, provider, checks, read-only hooks,
and cleanup inputs. External progress is resumable, not atomically reversible.
Guided setup is added only by a new snapshot, explicit Octon Mini upgrade, or
skill-package update. Current `octon` setup flags remain supported; legacy
Project Blueprint identities are migration inputs only. Setup answers never
silently overwrite project-owned authority or create runtime authorization.

## 3.1.0 — Unreleased

Source-governed architectural pattern integration without a universal-kernel
change. Accepted source decisions are `SRC-DEC-0003` through
`SRC-DEC-0006`.

### Added

- a strict source-only Domain-Neutral Architectural Pattern Catalog with
  stable `PAT-####` allocations, lifecycle transitions, promotion gates,
  evidence, contrary-evidence, compatibility, migration, successor, and
  non-authority validation;
- reviewed catalog records for `lifecycle-disposition`, modular
  `governed-change-and-effects`, and the optional Architecture Proof family;
- a source semantic crosswalk for authoritative, observed, inferred,
  proposed, derived, historical, superseded, stale, unknown, and intentionally
  omitted information without creating a universal status enum;
- a High-Assurance-only Context Pack manifest schema with executable expiry,
  revocation, recipient, scope, sensitivity, retention, exact-source, size,
  and non-authority fixtures;
- one source-only Architecture Proof schema and five templates for spikes,
  reference slices, provider qualification, adversarial fixture packs, and
  readiness evidence;
- a versioned, machine-readable generation-disposition policy with default
  source-only treatment, explicit profile-scoped reviewed paths, forbidden
  output paths, and explicit non-authority limitations;
- a read-only generation-policy diagnostic with normal, degraded, blocked, and
  recovering operation-local modes plus exact findings and recovery guidance;
  and
- source-contract and adversarial test commands integrated into Blueprint
  validation and acceptance.

### Changed

- the Generation Contract now names source-stable, generation-time identity,
  project-owned unresolved, and execution-volatile input classes and requires
  volatile facts to be revalidated at consequential boundaries;
- canonical dossier and harness guidance now cross-walks semantic information
  roles and requires consequential evidence to state non-proven implications;
- the High-Assurance Context Pack entry point explains its optional manifest
  lifecycle without generating a pack or assessing CTX-0001;
- new-project generation and adoption planning are allowlist-driven and scoped
  to the selected profile: unreviewed additions are ignored and reported,
  missing dependencies block only affected profiles, and source-only inputs,
  unsafe reviewed paths, forbidden destinations, collisions, or unexpected
  staged entries remain hard failures;
- hosted CI uses one stable minimum-runtime pull-request gate and one
  current-runtime `main` smoke check, while preserving the complete
  Python/operating-system matrix as a deliberate pre-release dispatch; and
- the Blueprint and generator versions advance to 3.1.0 while the unchanged
  universal harness kernel remains 3.0.0.

### Compatibility and migration note

This is an additive source and generator release. Existing 3.0.0 snapshots
remain independent and valid. Minimal and Standard receive no new governed
artifact or optional-contract path; newly generated High-Assurance snapshots
add only the unadopted Context Pack manifest schema. Existing Context Packs
are not converted. Pattern Catalog records and Architecture Proof assets are
never generated. See `migrations/3.0.0-to-3.1.0.md`.

## 3.0.0 — 2026-08-11

Small-team Git and provider-neutral change-integration workflows for one to
five write-capable humans.

This source release also records accepted source-only decisions
`SRC-DEC-0001` and `SRC-DEC-0002`. They do not become generated-project
defaults and create no permission.

Pull request #2 was integrated with `merge_commit` at
`1af3c1f85cd17e2c840857ad720e1a27e874585a`. GitHub Actions run `31539907441`
passed the full 12-job matrix on that exact `main` revision, and the annotated
`v3.0.0` tag was created there on 2026-08-11. No GitHub Release was created.

### Added

- a privacy-minimizing, evidence-dated collaboration profile that separates
  declared authority, observed access, activity, review capacity, concurrent
  writers, and external contribution mode without storing identities or
  granting permission;
- closed `solo_direct`, `solo_hybrid`, `pair_pr`, and `tiny_pr` workflow
  contracts plus a cross-profile `concurrent_work` modifier and an explicit
  `unsupported_team_size` result above five write-capable humans;
- a provider-neutral semantic Git and hosted-change operation catalog with
  distinct effect and authority classes, safe cleanup, conflict, tag, and
  force-with-lease boundaries, and fail-closed unknown operations;
- read-only collaboration assessment reporting, generated mutation coverage,
  and all-profile acceptance tests for topology, freshness, non-authorization,
  workflow completeness, and enterprise-workflow exclusion; and
- an executable, idempotent `2.0.0` to `3.0.0` reference migration that seeds
  an unknown collaboration state without inferring people or adopting a
  workflow.

### Changed

- assurance-profile selection now depends on project risk and control needs,
  not contributor count; team size selects only the base collaboration
  workflow;
- generated projects include the same complete small-team portfolio in every
  profile while GitHub-specific adoption remains optional and inactive;
- source CI validates feature work through `pull_request` and validates
  `push` only on `main`, with cancellation limited to superseded PR runs; and
- the blueprint, generator, harness kernel, project, tools, and validator
  contracts advance to their 3.0.0/v3-or-v2 forms.

### Migration note

This is a breaking change. Generated 2.0.0 snapshots remain independent.
Project-specific migration must preserve existing authority and decisions,
reassess collaboration from current project-owned evidence, and adopt a base
workflow through a separate accepted decision. Structural migration alone
does not establish readiness, permission, or a suitable workflow.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-08-10

Dependency-gated development progression for the domain-neutral kernel.

Under accepted source decision `SRC-DEC-0002`, `2.0.0` is a completed
historical release. Its annotated `v2.0.0` tag was created on 2026-08-11 and
targets exactly `ef8f352ca32a7fbdf1131726263ff545cdd8b08a`. The annotation
records the actual later tag-creation date and the 2026-08-10 source milestone;
it was not backdated.

### Added

- task and plan v2 records with typed hard dependencies, structured gate and
  blocker references, and reciprocal plan-item/execution-task links;
- a deterministic, read-only `--ready-frontier` command that reports eligible
  plan items and tasks without granting authority or assigning priority;
- task dependency-cycle detection and status checks that reject execution,
  review, or completion while hard predecessors, gates, blockers, or linked
  plan conditions are unsatisfied;
- plan progression checks that require linked tasks and evidence for
  completion and reject inconsistent reciprocal links or task status;
- adversarial coverage for cycles, incomplete predecessors, gates, blockers,
  reciprocal links, reopened dependencies, and ready-frontier derivation; and
- executable, idempotent `1.0.1` to `2.0.0` migration fixtures that preserve
  stable IDs and authority, retain exact rollback evidence, and fail closed on
  ambiguous or mixed live authority;
- strict three-state target-project test, lint, build, and closure hooks plus
  an explicit shell-free project-check evidence writer;
- adoption conformance that requires assessed hooks and current matching
  evidence, and prevents adopted High-Assurance projects from retaining
  unresolved conditional or optional triggers; and
- optional, independently adoptable operations/observability and
  security/supply-chain extension contracts with strict schemas, validators,
  freshness/reference checks, and adversarial fixtures.

### Changed

- entering or re-entering execution now passes through `ready`; `blocked` and
  `reopened` tasks transition to `ready` rather than directly to
  `in_progress`;
- the ready gate now requires satisfied dependencies and gates, resolved
  structured blockers, and coherent plan links in addition to scope,
  authority, acceptance criteria, and validation planning;
- planning explicitly treats dependencies as a partial order. Current operator
  direction or an accepted priority/value/risk decision selects among
  independent ready items; dates remain provenance, freshness, expiry, or
  genuine external constraints and never determine readiness or priority; and
- structural conformance, project-harness adoption, and demonstrated
  target-project readiness are reported as distinct conclusions; read-only
  validation never runs target-project hooks or creates execution evidence;
- Standard and High Assurance contain disabled, unassessed production-control
  entry points, while Minimal remains free of those controls; and
- the harness kernel, generator, validator, dossier baseline, task record, plan
  store, lifecycle, project-command, and validator contracts advance to their
  2.0.0/v2 forms.

### Migration note

This is a breaking change. Generated `1.0.1` projects remain independent and
must use a project-specific migration; do not copy v2 kernel, validator, task,
plan, project-command, or evidence files over live project authority. The
reference migrator validates a closed representative bundle; it is not an
in-place target-project upgrader and does not run project commands.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-08-10

Historical status correction under `SRC-DEC-0002`: this version was committed
as `d94550a8acf57841eac9458897410391722beb4b` on 2026-08-10 and is retained
as an untagged, superseded source milestone rather than a completed tagged
release. Its content and migration compatibility remain supported; no
`v1.0.1` tag is to be created.

Release-blocker remediation for the stable domain-neutral kernel.

### Fixed

- every profile now has a supported transactional refresh path for catalogs,
  path authority, manifests, and profile-specific derived evidence;
- project-local dossier registration supports adding, removing, renaming, and
  superseding project artifacts without editing derived files;
- the dossier taxonomy separates conceptual artifact types, blueprint
  representations, and project artifact records and supplies self-contained
  schemas for their machine-readable forms;
- validator coverage now enforces declared lifecycle, record-reference,
  authority, gate, supersession, path-confinement, extension, redaction, and
  read-only boundaries rather than merely documenting them;
- generated validators enforce the selected profile's required governed-file
  inventory and reject missing, misplaced, or unknown live-governance
  material;
- `current.json` is a closed, project-maintained resumption index whose task,
  decision, evidence, external-authority, and adoption references must resolve
  and remain status-coherent; it cannot authorize work;
- task and artifact closure plus readiness gates require fresh, subject-bound
  passing evidence; waivers and approval-backed gates require current,
  externally sourced authority evidence that is neither revoked nor
  superseded;
- adoption planning reports conservative functional-equivalent candidates
  while remaining read-only and non-authorizing;
- generation transaction IDs are unpredictable and unique rather than
  deterministically derived;
- reference evidence has explicit provenance and authority classification, and
  citations are checked against that registry.

### Added

- conditional approval, coordination, recovery, evaluation, and metric
  contracts for projects whose risk triggers require them;
- closed agent, workflow, and skill-provenance JSON contracts with exact
  included-file provenance, pinned fingerprints for adopted imports, strict
  deprecation/removal rules, and adopted dependency-chain validation;
- traceable adoption-decision contracts: generated baselines remain null and
  unadopted, while adopted harnesses and capabilities resolve to accepted
  externally authoritative decisions;
- adversarial tests for catalog traversal, nested instructions, stale
  derivatives, malformed extensions, unsafe environment access, duplicate
  identifiers, invalid semantic versions, record references, and source-only
  validation;
- a `1.0.0` to `1.0.1` migration guide and reproducible repository-contained
  skill-package validation.

### Changed

- Python 3.11 remains the reference implementation, while an alternate pinned
  runtime is permitted only when it passes the published conformance fixtures;
- extension checks run with a least-privilege environment and detect persistent
  repository mutation; prevention still requires an external no-write boundary;
- validation reports are bounded to checks actually performed and explicitly
  disclose scope, result, failures, skipped checks, limitations, Git
  dirty-state assessment, and external effects; structural success does not
  imply project readiness.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-27

First stable domain-neutral kernel release.

### Added

- self-contained project dossier blueprint with evidence-labeled reference
  crosswalk, 4-digit artifact taxonomy, coverage profiles, core
  specifications, lifecycle, governance, adoption gates, and new
  recommendations;
- evidence-labeled 17-section harness blueprint and source-evidence record;
- strict JSON seven-file governance kernel and local schema snapshot;
- generated artifact catalog and per-file path-authority mirror;
- transactional new-project generation and read-only existing-project
  adoption planning;
- cross-record reference, transition, traceability, plan-DAG, nested
  instruction, extension, secret-redaction, checksum, and freshness
  validation;
- restrictions-only versioned extension API with a disable-safe reference
  extension;
- mutually consistent high-assurance refresh outputs with shared generation
  IDs;
- Minimal, Standard, and High-Assurance end-to-end and adversarial acceptance
  tests;
- migration, release, installation, and CI guidance.

### Changed

- canonical structured outputs moved from constrained YAML to strict JSON;
- stable dossier record and artifact identifiers use four numeric digits;
- generated dossier registries start empty and unadopted rather than seeding
  active or authoritative project claims;
- integrity fingerprints cover the whole repository by default.

### Removed

- direct in-place generation into existing repositories;
- regex-only constrained-YAML validation;
- disconnected high-assurance checksum refresh behavior.
