# Octon Mini Project Bootstrap

Build an independent project snapshot. Transfer structure and validators, never
facts, identities, permissions, accepted decisions, evidence, or readiness.

## Start

1. Read every applicable target-repository instruction.
2. Inspect source control, files, implementation, and existing documentation.
3. Read only the references needed for the task:
   - dossier: `references/dossier-model.md`;
   - harness: `references/harness-model.md`;
   - profile/layout/collaboration: `references/profile-selection.md`;
   - creation, adoption, maintenance, recovery, upgrade:
     `references/generation-workflow.md`;
   - conversational, TTY, or answer-file setup and resume:
     `references/guided-setup.md`.
4. Keep these axes independent:
   - Minimal, Standard, High Assurance: project risk and assurance;
   - solo, pair, tiny: one, two, or three-to-five write-capable humans;
   - `concurrent_work`: simultaneous humans, agents, or automation;
   - compact or separated: physical representation layout.

## Workflow

Use the source `scripts/octon.py` interface for bootstrap operations. Its
authoritative command inventory is projected to every generated
`.agent/commands.json`, where each command labels its bootstrap-source or
generated-project availability; primitive scripts remain advanced diagnostics.
The source checkout exposes the dispatcher through root `octon`; an installed
skill exposes it at `assets/octon-mini-source/octon`. From either launcher root,
use `./octon` on Unix/macOS, or invoke the same file as `python -B octon` or
`py -3 -B octon` on Windows. Generated projects use the same platform forms and
command identity with their generated-project command inventory.

- Guided setup: use `octon init|adopt|upgrade setup`. Determine mode from target
  evidence, stop on ambiguity, inspect read-only, and ask only unresolved
  dependency-eligible catalog questions—normally one to three at a time. State
  importance, choices, recommendation/rationale, allowed unknown or deferral,
  and blocked consequences without preselecting an answer. Keep observations,
  inferences, recommendations, selections, accepted-authority references,
  unknowns, deferrals, and runtime authorization distinct. Write a session only
  to an explicitly requested external path, use immutable successors, summarize
  before planning, and bind `--setup-session` into the existing planner.
- Guided one-command operation: use interactive `octon init`, `octon adopt`, or
  `octon upgrade` with an explicit target and external review directory. Let it
  inspect, ask only unresolved blockers, create immutable session/plan
  artifacts, show the shared summary and full digest, ask once for confirmation,
  then revalidate before apply. A collision or review gate must preserve the
  artifacts and return the Continuation Contract; never guess or auto-apply.
- New project: `octon init plan|apply`. Non-interactive planning requires an
  explicit profile flag or a reviewed setup-session answer. Interactive
  `octon init` proposes Minimal and requires confirmation. Archetypes, hooks, and collaboration are proposals; create a
  first task only from explicitly supplied purpose, scope, authority,
  acceptance, ownership, validation, and next action.
- Established project: `octon adopt plan|apply`. Use the default bounded semantic
  inspection; review every functional equivalent or authority collision.
  Adoption apply never overwrites existing content and leaves adoption
  `in_progress`.
- Routine work: generated `octon work start|block|close|reopen|handoff|resume`.
  Lifecycle writers allocate IDs and synchronize mechanical links and derived
  state, but never invent scope, authority, criteria, review, evidence, or
  external-effect authorization.
- Long-running work: use generated `octon work run` only after the optional
  `long-running-work` package is transactionally installed and separately
  adopted through a current accepted project decision. Bind one run to an
  existing task and exact path narrowing; compile deterministic context, accept
  only its current digest, perform effects only through existing transaction or
  `work.finish` boundaries, require current validation before progress, and
  resume only from marker-backed checkpoints. Status, context, resume, and
  explain are read-only. Never replay an ambiguous effect or treat run state as
  task scope, permission, acceptance, release, or readiness.
- Governed completion: use `octon work finish plan|apply|resume` only after the
  project explicitly enables the shared engine and adopts the installed
  small-team Git workflow. Planning is read-only. Apply requires the exact
  digest, unchanged preconditions, and current task-scoped authorization for
  its exact external operations; external progress is resumable and cannot
  claim atomic rollback. The disabled-by-default completion event may dispatch
  only the exact read-only plan hook after successful task closure.
- Configuration: use `octon maintain hooks`, `octon maintain collaboration`,
  `octon maintain registry`, and source `octon maintain package` plan/apply flows.
  Package applicability, owner, trust decision, version, digest, and successful
  receipt evidence are mandatory.
- Validation: `octon check` is always read-only and never runs project hooks.
  `octon maintain refresh --apply` is the explicit generated-integrity writer.
  `.agent/scripts/run_project_checks.py --write-evidence` is the separately
  explicit hook/evidence writer.
- Routine proof reuse: only the explicit project-check writer may pass
  `--reuse-proofs`, and only for an exact current unexpired passing `read_only`
  proof. Input, tool/version, configuration, instruction, environment, effect,
  or freshness changes are misses. Never reuse at adoption/release gates or for
  external state or runtime authorization.
- Recovery: use `octon doctor`, then exact `octon transaction recover` for a pending
  journal or `octon transaction rollback` for an unchanged applied receipt. Never
  add or simulate a force bypass.
- Continuation and bundles: render human output concisely and use `--json` for
  strict automation. A covered refusal states mutation outcome, invalidated and
  preserved proofs, owning source, and one shell-free next argv. Bundle only
  compatible reversible repository-local plans through `octon transaction
  bundle plan`; reject overlaps, different authority/freshness/confirmation,
  nested bundles, and external or monotonic effects.
- Upgrade: use the applicable migration guide and `octon upgrade plan|apply`.
  The 3.1→4.0 path first creates a reviewed legacy inventory seed. Automatic
  upgrade is limited to safe additions, exact-pristine non-authoritative
  implementation assets, and derived regeneration.

Every plan is non-authorizing and content-addressed. Repository-local mutation
plans are instruction- and path-fingerprint-bound, staged, validated,
receipted, and exactly recoverable. Governed external completion instead uses
monotonic evidence-backed receipts and safe resume or fix-forward. Stale or
ambiguous plans fail closed.

Setup-session v2 preserves a prior value only while its declared question,
dependency, instruction, evidence, authority, and expiry bindings remain
current. Accepted project decisions may be reused only through the empty-by-
default project-owned decision-reuse registry and never as operation
confirmation, runtime authorization, external-action permission, or readiness.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- The dossier is documentation, never permission.
- Generated policy is deny-by-default and cannot create authority.
- Existing target paths are never silently overwritten.
- Stable IDs and authority ownership are never silently reassigned.
- Generated snapshots remain independent and versioned.
- Optional long-running work is absent and inactive by default; a dormant
  dispatcher and unassessed trigger do not establish applicability or adoption.
- The installed source bundle includes the repository MIT-0 license; generated
  projects do not receive that `LICENSE` file or a project-wide license choice.
- `check`, detection, diagnosis, planning, and resume views are read-only.
- Guided question generation is target-read-only; session output is explicit,
  external to the target, non-authorizing, and secret-free.
- Generated-integrity and project-check evidence writes stay explicit and
  separate.
- External, destructive, credentialed, financial, legal, publication,
  deployment, communication, and production effects require explicit current
  authorization.
- Inferences remain sourced, timed, confidence-scored, limited, previewable,
  overridable, and recoverable.
- Structural conformance, harness adoption, and target-project readiness are
  separate claims.
- Trigger absence never means `not_applicable`.
- The Git portfolio is installed only when Git is explicitly selected; an
  uninstalled portfolio is not a runtime dependency.
- Generated work completion and its event hook start disabled. A completion
  event may automatically create only a read-only plan; it cannot apply.
- Require Python 3.11 or newer and strict JSON for the kernel.
