# Real-Project Usability Validation Protocol

## Status and boundary

This is a source-only method for running and reporting bounded Octon Mini
usability exercises. It is not generated into target projects. Its presence
does not prove that an exercise occurred, create evidence, grant permission,
adopt a harness or workflow, accept a decision, or establish release or
target-project readiness.

Every report is limited to its exact Octon Mini revision, disposable subject,
baseline, environment, operator, observation window, and exercised journey.
Synthetic validation remains synthetic. A real-project exercise does not
convert structural conformance into project adoption, and project adoption does
not establish implementation, specialist, release, or production readiness.

## Required exercise matrix

Use several projects rather than treating one favorable journey as universal
evidence. The minimum matrix is:

| Scenario | Required boundary |
|---|---|
| Greenfield software initialization | Explicit profile and layout; setup, reviewed plan, apply, first meaningful task, check, and resume in a disposable target |
| Established dirty Git repository adoption | Bounded inspection, existing-byte preservation, collision/authority review, unchanged pre-apply tree, staged apply in a disposable copy, and adoption left `in_progress` |
| Non-software project | Research, brand, operations, product, business, or hybrid subject; use domain-neutral outcome and workstream language |
| Reviewed 3.1 predecessor snapshot through the current Octon Mini migration | Reviewed legacy inventory seed, three-way classification, explicit dispositions, apply, idempotence, rollback evidence, and no retired compatibility surface |
| Unfamiliar operator | Include when an authorized participant without prior Octon Mini operating knowledge is available; otherwise record `not_run` and the limitation |
| Pair or tiny workflow | Exercise only when actual current write-capable maintainer and eligible independent-review capacity exists; never simulate a reviewer or count self/agent review |

Follow the applicable paths in `docs/GOLDEN_PATHS.md` and the reviewed migration
procedure in `migrations/3.1.0-to-4.0.0.md`. A report may cover more than one
scenario only when each scenario retains its own subject, method, observations,
and limitations.

When optional long-running work is the subject, extend the matrix with a
multi-step software task and one documentation, structured-content, research,
or analysis task. Exercise deterministic context, several validated iterations,
pause/restart, changed instructions, repeated validation failure, exact budget
exhaustion, deliberate no progress, context pressure, marker-backed recovery,
and a safe local outcome-unknown fixture. Record interventions, iterations,
elapsed machine time, resume time, context bytes, critical omissions, stuck
findings, validation failures, false-success incidents, residual dirty state,
and recovery result. Do not use a real provider effect merely to populate the
report.

## Authorization, privacy, and isolation prerequisites

Before inspection or execution, record:

- current project-owner authorization for the exact exercise, subject copy,
  local mutations, and any deliberately tested recovery operation;
- operator participation and observation consent when another person is
  involved;
- the permitted information-retention boundary and any project-specific
  sensitivity exclusions;
- an explicit external-effect posture, normally `none`; and
- stop conditions for unexpected writes, credential access, privacy exposure,
  unauthorized network activity, an ambiguous plan, or inability to restore.

Use a disposable copy, short-lived branch, or dedicated worktree whose
creation and cleanup are authorized. Never reset, stash, overwrite, or run a
destructive probe against the original project to make an exercise convenient.
Do not use live credentials, production data, or external publication. If an
authorized scenario genuinely requires an external observation or effect,
record its separate authority and limitations; the protocol itself supplies
none.

Committed evidence must be content-free. Do not retain project content, real
paths, collaborator identities, secret values, raw command output, repository
URLs, or sensitive filenames. Use an opaque subject label, aggregate counts,
sanitized argv, result classifications, durations, and SHA-256 digests of
separately retained evidence. Keep any necessary raw material outside this
repository under the project's own access, retention, and deletion rules.

## Subject and environment binding

Bind each exercise to:

- exact Octon Mini commit SHA and version, with clean/dirty disclosure;
- opaque target label, project archetype, baseline revision or content
  fingerprint, intentional dirty-state class, and disposable-subject method;
- observation start/end with timezone;
- operating system/release, architecture, filesystem context, Python and Git
  versions, and launcher form;
- selected assurance profile and physical layout;
- current collaboration evidence, adopted workflow status, independent-review
  capacity, and concurrency modifier;
- network availability and external-effect boundary; and
- every unavailable, skipped, or altered prerequisite.

Exploratory work on a dirty Octon Mini source checkout may reveal defects but
cannot support final-candidate evidence. A later source change requires a new
report or explicit revalidation on the changed revision.

## Exercise method

1. Capture the exact source and disposable-target baselines, status, modes,
   symlinks, ignored/untracked scope, and governing instructions without
   refreshing either project.
2. State the expected documented golden path, success boundary, stop
   conditions, cleanup, and evidence plan before executing it.
3. Follow only documented entry points. Record every command, question,
   semantic input, owner choice, maintainer assist, replan, workaround, and
   confusion point rather than silently supplying hidden expertise.
4. Keep machine command time separate from human reading, interpretation,
   review, and decision time.
5. Perform safety probes only in the disposable subject and only when the
   probe has a supported recovery path.
6. Compare the final disposable state with its baseline and with every claimed
   plan, receipt, rollback, and retained evidence digest.
7. Clean up the disposable subject under its recorded authority, verify
   residual effects, and produce the content-free report.

No usability exercise introduces or relaxes a performance threshold. Record
slow behavior and environment context without reclassifying it as success or
failure beyond the existing benchmark and release contracts.

## Required measurements

Record at least:

- per-command elapsed time, exit status, and sanitized evidence reference;
- human reading/review/decision time, separately measured or explicitly
  unavailable;
- command count, distinct semantic inputs, project-owned decisions, and files
  hand-edited by the operator;
- generated touchpoints versus manual touchpoints;
- maintainer assists, replans, plan refusals, and workarounds;
- detector candidates rejected by the operator, false collision
  classifications, irrelevant diagnostics, and other false positives;
- observed false negatives or missing guidance;
- operator confusion points and time to the first actionable diagnostic; and
- time to valid scaffold/adoption proposal, first meaningful task, closure,
  recovery, and resumption when those stages apply.

## Required safety observations

| Boundary | Required observation |
|---|---|
| Read-only behavior | Before/after tracked, untracked, ignored, mode, symlink, cache, and relevant metadata comparison; disclose the exact coverage and any unavailable observation |
| Collision and overwrite | Controlled disposable collision is classified and refused or explicitly routed to proposal-bound review; established bytes remain unchanged before accepted apply |
| Stale plan | A controlled in-scope change after planning causes deterministic refusal with no target mutation |
| Rollback | Applied paths match recorded postimages before rollback and exact preimages afterward; any independently changed path refuses rollback |
| Interruption/recovery | Use a supported injection point and exact recovery path; if none is safe, record `not_run` rather than simulating success |
| Dirty adoption | Intentional tracked/untracked/ignored state remains preserved and disclosed throughout inspection and apply |
| Migration | Reviewed old baseline, current project, and candidate bytes remain distinct; ambiguous and authority-bearing paths require dispositions |
| External effects | None by default; any separately authorized effect records exact scope, result, residual state, and non-rollback boundary |

## Finding severity and release disposition

These classifications apply only to a report finding. They are not universal
project statuses and do not themselves make a release decision.

| Disposition | Criteria |
|---|---|
| `block_candidate` | Credible data loss, overwrite, authority bypass, stale-plan acceptance, rollback/recovery failure, or unauthorized external effect. One credible occurrence blocks the candidate pending investigation. |
| `block_when_confirmed` | Reproducible supported-platform failure or a documented golden path that cannot complete without undocumented maintainer intervention. |
| `owner_review_required` | Potentially material evidence is confounded, incomplete, ambiguous, or not yet reproducible; it cannot count as a pass. |
| `follow_up` | The safe workflow completes, but performance, friction, false detection, confusion, or documentation burden remains. |
| `informational_or_out_of_scope` | Preference, unsupported environment, or observation not attributable to the exact candidate. |

Unavailable unfamiliar operators, reviewer capacity, platforms, or safe fault
injection remain `not_run` with limitations. Absence of field evidence is a
disclosed gap, not a fabricated pass or automatic blocker. A report affects a
release only through the applicable release gate and owner disposition.

## Claims, retention, and cleanup

A report may support only bounded statements about the observed journey, such
as whether a documented command completed, a refusal occurred, or an operator
found a step without hidden assistance. It cannot establish suitability for
all projects, qualified security/privacy/legal conclusions, production safety,
organizational approval, reviewer availability beyond the observation,
external provider state, or release authority.

Retain content-free reports and digests according to the recorded release
evidence policy. Record the raw-evidence custodian, external location class,
retention deadline, deletion basis, cleanup result, residual files/effects, and
any evidence that could not be retained. Cleanup must not delete evidence still
required for a finding, rollback, or release disposition.

## Reusable report template

Copy this section into a separate report only after an exercise occurs. Leave
unknown fields explicit; do not prefill a pass, accepted review, owner choice,
authority, or readiness conclusion.
